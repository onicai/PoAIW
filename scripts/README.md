# PoAIW scripts

This folder contains python notebooks to help with the design of prompts & LLM settings for the Challenger, mAIner and Judge.

## Python

Create a python environment with the required dependencies installed:

We use MiniConda:

```
conda create --name PoAIW python=3.11
conda activate PoAIW

# from PoAIW/scripts folder:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the notebooks

Now open the notebooks (*.ipynb) in VS Code, and run them:
- you must have the VS Code Python extension installed
- For the Python kernel, select the `PoAIW` miniconda environment
